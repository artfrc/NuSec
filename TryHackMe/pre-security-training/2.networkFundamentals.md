# 🌐 Network fundamentals

### IP Address 

An IP address consists of four octets, each ranging from 0 to 255 (192.168.1.77)

---
#### IPv4: Supports ~4.29 billion addresses (2³²).  `86.157.52.21`
#### IPv6: Supports 340 trillion+ addresses (2¹²⁸) `2a00:22c4:a531:c500:425f:cce6:c36b:f64d`

---
### MAC Address (Media Access Control) 🔗
Format: `a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d`

First 6 characters: Manufacturer 🏭

Last 6 characters: Unique ID 🆔

---

### MAC Spoofing
- MAC addresses can be **faked (spoofed)** 🎭.
- This can **bypass security** if access control relies solely on MAC addresses.

---

### 📬 Ping and ICMP
- The `ping` command uses **ICMP packets** to test network connectivity 📡.
- ICMP sends an **echo request** and expects an **echo reply** to measure latency ⏱️.

### 🌐 LAN Topologies

#### Star Topology ⭐
- Devices connect via a **central switch/hub**.
- Failure of the central device disrupts all communication 🚫.

#### Bus Topology 🚌
- Devices share a **single backbone cable**.

#### Ring Topology 🔄
- Devices are connected in a **loop**.

### 🌐 Subnetting
Subnetting divides a network into **smaller subnetworks** 🛠️.

#### Components:
- **Network Address**: e.g., `192.168.1.0`
- **Host Address**: e.g., `192.168.1.1`
- **Default Gateway**: e.g., `.1` or `.254`, used for routing external traffic 🚦.

---

### 🔄 ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- Maps **IP addresses to MAC addresses** 🔗.
- Devices maintain an **ARP cache** 🗃️.

#### ARP Workflow:
1. **ARP Request**: "Who has this IP?" 📢
2. **ARP Reply**: "I do! Here’s my MAC address." 🗣️

---

### 🤝 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Automatically assigns **IP addresses** to devices 📡.

#### Process:
1. **DHCP Discover**: "Can anyone give me an IP?" 🔍
2. **DHCP Offer**: "Here’s `192.168.1.10`." 📬
3. **DHCP Request**: "I’ll take it!" ✅
4. **DHCP Acknowledgment**: "Good for 24 hours." ⏳

### 📚 OSI Model
The OSI model defines seven layers for network communication:

1. **Physical** ⚡️: Hardware transmission (e.g., Ethernet).
2. **Data Link** 🔗: MAC addressing and data formatting.
3. **Network** 🌐: Routing using IP addresses. Protocols: OSPF, RIP.
4. **Transport** 🚚: Ensures data delivery.
   - **TCP**: Reliable, slower 🐢.
   - **UDP**: Fast, no guarantee 🏃.
5. **Session** 🤝: Manages sessions and checkpoints.
6. **Presentation** 🎨: Data formatting and translation.
7. **Application** 📱: User-level protocols and interfaces.
