# 🌐 DNS Overview

### 🌍 DNS (Domain Name System)
Provides a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers. 🚀

#### 🏰 Domain Hierarchy

#### 📋 Types of DNS
- **A record** 📍: Resolves IPv4 addresses, for example, 104.26.10.229.
- **AAAA record** 🌐: Resolves IPv6 addresses, for example, 2606:4700:20::681a:be5.
- **CNAME records** 🔗: These records resolve to another domain name. For example, TryHackMe's online shop has the subdomain name store.tryhackme.com, which returns a CNAME record shops.shopify.com.
- **MX record** ✉️: These records resolve to the address of the servers that handle email for the domain you are querying.

#### 🔍 What happens when you make a DNS request
1. Your computer checks its local cache for the domain's address. If not found, it queries a Recursive DNS Server.

2. The Recursive DNS Server, often provided by your ISP, checks its cache. If the address is cached, it returns it; otherwise, it queries the internet's root DNS servers.

3. Root servers redirect the request to the appropriate Top Level Domain (TLD) server (e.g., .com for www.tryhackme.com).

4. The TLD server points to the authoritative nameserver for the domain (e.g., kip.ns.cloudflare.com for tryhackme.com).

5. The authoritative server provides the DNS record, which is cached by the Recursive DNS Server with a TTL (Time To Live) and sent back to your computer.
