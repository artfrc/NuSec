### 📜 Rules of Engagement (ROE)
The **Rules of Engagement (ROE)** is a critical document created at the start of a penetration testing engagement.

| Section       | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Permission** 📝 | Grants explicit legal permission for the engagement to proceed.            |
| **Test Scope** 🎯 | Specifies the targets (e.g., specific servers or applications) to be tested. |
| **Rules** ⚖️ | Defines permitted techniques (e.g., allowing MITM attacks but prohibiting phishing). |

### 🔄 Methodologies
Penetration testing follows structured methodologies with these common stages:

#### 1. Information Gathering 🕵️
- Collect publicly accessible information about the target (e.g., OSINT, research).  
- **Note**: No system Germ or system scanning is involved at this stage.

#### 2. Enumeration/Scanning 🔍
- Discover applications and services running on systems (e.g., identifying a vulnerable web server).

#### 3. Exploitation 💥
- Leverage vulnerabilities found in systems or applications using public exploits or logic flaws.

#### 4. Privilege Escalation ⬆️
- Expand access after gaining a foothold.  
  - **Horizontal**: Access another account with the same permissions (e.g., another user).  
  - **Vertical**: Access an account with higher permissions (e.g., an administrator).

#### 5. Post-Exploitation 🛠️
- Sub-stages include:  
  1. **Pivoting**: Target additional hosts.  
  2. **Data Gathering**: Collect more information as a privileged user.  
  3. **Covering Tracks**: Hide evidence of the attack.  
  4. **Reporting**: Document findings.

### 🎭 Black Box, White Box, Grey Box Penetration Testing

#### Black-Box Testing 🌑
- High-level testing with **no knowledge** of the application's internal workings.  

#### Grey-Box Testing 🌗
- Testers have **limited knowledge** of internal components but interact as if in a black-box scenario, using their knowledge to troubleshoot issues.

#### White-Box Testing ☀️
- Low-level testing typically performed by developers.  
- Focuses on testing **internal components** and ensuring functions work correctly and efficiently.
